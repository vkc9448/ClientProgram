* Plugin includes: fullpage, fakeLoader, avgrund, topbutton
*       1st plugin: fullpage for fullscreen/onepage scroll sections jquery plugin, common minimalist website
*       2nd plugin: fakeLoader to create a spinner for the page preloading effect, added a RIT tiger gif instead of the gear gif provided in class
*       3rd plugin: avgrund for modal boxes (organizing each contents) and create a popup effect
*       4th plugin: topbutton to scroll the page up back to section0 with a specific scroll speed/duration
* IE support up to 9, anything below = new browser to http://outdatedbrowser.com/en
* This site is not done, I only focus on getting the plugin to work. CSS still needs more work and I left some other
* .js and .css files for future use, as I'm planning on improving it over time.
